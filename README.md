⚡ Memoized Filtering - Reduces unnecessary recalculations
⚡ Efficient Rendering - Only re-renders affected components

Future Enhancements
Add due dates and deadlines

Implement task categories/tags

Add drag-and-drop reordering

Include user authentication

Add server persistence (Firebase/Node.js backend)

Interviewer Notes
This implementation demonstrates:

Clean component architecture

Proper TypeScript usage

Effective state management

Performance considerations

Attention to UX details

Modern React patterns

The code is well-commented and organized to showcase my understanding of React best practices. I've included several optimizations that go beyond the basic requirements to demonstrate my ability to think about performance and user experience.
